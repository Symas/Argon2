# Argon2
Adding in the Argon2 Module
I'd prefer to see an argon2 module that could be used (possibly via libsodium).
The author reminded me he's already written an argon module for OpenLDAP:
<http://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/?findid=8575>
and wants it added.  Something we should seriously look at getting included in both OpenLDAP and SOLD.  Perhaps with SOLD have it part of our default example configuration and what we teach in the LDAP-U course.
